# javascript-challenge

For this project I created a table dynamically based upon a dataset, data.js file, about aliens and UFOs.

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js to create the web pages, the user is able to put specific values into the data on the web page and receive an output. 

Input tags are created so that the user can search for information based on the following:

-  date/time

-  City

-  State

-  Country

-  shape
